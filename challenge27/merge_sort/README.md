##  step-by-step algorithm and a visualization of the Merge Sort process for the input array [8, 4, 23, 42]:

* Step 1: Merge Sort for [8, 4, 23, 42]

Divide the array into two halves: left=[8, 4] and right=[23, 42].
Recursively sort each half:
 Left Half: [8, 4] -> Split into left=[8] and right=[4] (already sorted).
Right Half: [23, 42] -> Split into left=[23] and right=[42] (already sorted).
* Step 2: Merge the two sorted halves [8] and [4] to get the sorted left half [4, 8].
* Step 3: Merge the two sorted halves [23] and [42] to get the sorted right half [23, 42].
* Step 4: Merge the two sorted halves [4, 8] and [23, 42] to get the final sorted array [4, 8, 23, 42]

Original Array: [8, 4, 23, 42]
```
Step 1:
Divide:                 Merge:
       [8, 4, 23, 42]            [8, 4, 23, 42]
        /           \              /             \
   [8, 4]       [23, 42]        [4, 8]       [23, 42]
    /     \       /     \          /   \         /     \
 [8]    [4]   [23]    [42]     [4]   [8]    [23]   [42]

 ```

Step 2:
Merge the sorted halves [8] and [4] to get [4, 8]

Step 3:
Merge the sorted halves [23] and [42] to get [23, 42]

Step 4:
Merge the sorted halves [4, 8] and [23, 42] to get the final sorted array [4, 8, 23, 42]
