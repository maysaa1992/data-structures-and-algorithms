# Challenge stack and queue 
pop and push to the stack 
enpueue and dequeue to the queue 


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
pop -> o(1)
push -> o(1)
enqueue ->(1)
dequeue -> o(1)
## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
python stack.py
python queue.py
pytest
